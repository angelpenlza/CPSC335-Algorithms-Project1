# CPSC335-Algorithms-Project1
To Do:
1. Develop a complete and clear pseudocode for the two algorithms
2. Mathematically analyze your pseudocode and prove the efficiency class, using either
induction, limits or step counts. State the method used.
3. Produce a brief written project report in PDF format. Your report should include:
a. Your name(s), CSUF-supplied email address(es)
b. Pseudocode
c. proving efficiency of the pseudocode (Todo: 2)
Upload this pdf file to GitHub: Folder structure in GitHub:

- Report
- Code
Algorithm 2
Algorithm 3
4. Implement your algorithms in Python or C++. Your codes should be well commented,
including your name(s). and uploaded to GitHub.
5. Your canvas submission should contain link to the GitHub project.

Algorithm 1 was completed in its entirety by Carlos Lopez. 
	All functions and the class were created and tested by Carlos.
Algorithm 2 was completed in its entirety by Ryan Monte. 
Algorithm 3 was split between Angel Penaloza and Boushra Bettir. 
 	Angel worked on the class Schedule() { } aspect of the code, focusing on an individual's schedule. 
 	Boushra worked on the class Group() { } aspect of the code, which used the individual's formatted schedule to find overlapping free intervals.
