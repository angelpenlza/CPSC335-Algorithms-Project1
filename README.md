# CPSC335-Algorithms-Project1
To Do:
1. Develop a complete and clear pseudocode for the two algorithms
2. Mathematically analyze your pseudocode and prove the efficiency class, using either
induction, limits or step counts. State the method used.
3. Produce a brief written project report in PDF format. Your report should include:
a. Your name(s), CSUF-supplied email address(es)
b. Pseudocode
c. proving efficiency of the pseudocode (Todo: 2)
Upload this pdf file to GitHub: Folder structure in GitHub:
Algorithm 1
- Report
- Code
Algorithm 2
Algorithm 3
4. Implement your algorithms in Python or C++. Your codes should be well commented,
including your name(s). and uploaded to GitHub.
5. Your canvas submission should contain link to the GitHub project.

Grading Rubric
The suggested grading rubric for all the three algorithms is given below:
Algorithm (50 points)
a. Clear and complete Pseudocode = 10 points
b. Mathematical analysis and correct Big O efficiency class = 5 points
c. Inclusion of a Readme file and well commented codes = 5 points
d. Successful compilation of codes= 25 points
e. Produces accurate results = 5 points
Total of 3 algorithms -> 50*3 => 150 total points.
